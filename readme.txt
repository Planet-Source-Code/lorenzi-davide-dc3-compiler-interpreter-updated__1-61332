DC3 Compiler - Interpreter
--------------------------

!!!Only for developers!!!

DC3 is a complete but limited (because I've neither the time 
nor the will to enhance it) VB like compiler/interpreter 
that can be used for learning how to create a complete 
and fully functional compiler. It comes with its complete 
source code in Visual Basic 6.
It compiles simple VB like programs and creates a byte 
code executed by a Virtual Machine, 
like Java and .NET languages.

The .zip file contains only the sources of DC3; in order to
make this project to work you MUST have Microsoft Visual Basic 6 
and GOLD PARSER Builder / Engine installed into your machine.
